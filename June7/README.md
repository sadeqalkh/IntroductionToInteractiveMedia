##### The concept of this program is to let the users experiment with the human eye pupil's reaction to light. The X-axis movements of the mouse represent the light source from my program.

- This assignment helped me discover the usage of transformation in a program and its usefulness. In the past assignments, my ideas had many variables in one program. It was challenging with not knowing a method and not to complicate the program.

- The challenges I experienced in this program was to simplify the code for a better understanding. In my previous version, I experienced issues with variables. I debugged this problem by adding all the line() variables in a for loop, to represent one step in the program instead of 10 line() variables separately.
  I also encountered issues with scale() transformation.  My intension in scale() is to have a specified range within the X-axis that executes a smooth motion for the user. In my program, this idea by implementing scale() transformation is not working as intended in the pupil because scale() tends to disappear after executing the maximum value in a positive X-axis plane.
