In this assignment, I have familiarized myself with the usage of different shapes in processing. In which, I discovered that I could control the levels of the color black in fill() and background(). I realized from today's class how arc() is helpful when seeking for curvy shapes in processing.
In this assignment, I also ran through many obstacles, such as in arc() and triangle(). In arc(), I discovered that I could not have an anti-clockwise area of a circle and especially a specific range in an arc; for instance, 120 to 180 degrees. This issue leads me to not apply a second side to my subject's nose due to its angle and curvature. The second issue, which is triangle(), was a recovery plan for the first issue. I intended to have the base of the nose as a triangle with two end ellipses from the left and right of the triangle. The plan was proceeding until I realized issues moving the triangle to my intended location in the face. I looked through the processing site, but I only found the structure of triangle() in the program, which consisted only of dimensions through the x and y plane. I tried to manipulate the dimensions of the triangle() to set it into my destined spot; however, it ended up with a total mess and resulted in me removing it from my drawing. Thus, these issues lead me to apply a one-dimensional look to the subject's nose.
