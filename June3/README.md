##### The concept of this program is to portray the well-known tower "Burj Khalifa" as a flowing structure in an output screen. I have applied rectangles on top of each other and extended them each time by adding 10 pixels to represent the Burj's balconies.

- This assignment helped me understand the importance of having the implementation of object-oriented programming in processing. In which, following this concept in the program has answered some problems I have encountered in the past assignment.

- The challenges I have encountered in this program is the confusion I have experienced while trying to create my initial idea of this assignment. The assignment was structured to be not represented as a flowing Burj in the output screen. Instead, I intended to have the rectangles move in within the horizontal axis and then reach an endpoint of (0,0) of the output screen.
