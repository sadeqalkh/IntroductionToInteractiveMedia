The resistors in the schematic diagram will be 330 Ohms.

### Arduino to Processing:

In Arduino, the analog sensor "ultrasonic distance measuring sensor" will transmit recieved data from surroundings to the Processing. In which, I will create 3 different ranges followed by a text in within the field of 2-400 cm. 

### Processing to Arduino:

In Processing, the data recieved from that alnalog sensor will motivate Arduino's LEDs to light up with a unique order that matches the specified ranges.
