### Concept:

The program's concept is to enhance the safety of the users from the COVID-19 pandemic. The user in this program will be alerted by three Processing background colors, and three LED lights. The backgrounds and lights are in RED, YELLOW, and GREEN. The RED color in this program is considered a danger zone or a region in which the user is experiencing outside his house. YELLOW color represents an average zone in which the user can suffer in case of over crowdings. The program within the second stage, which is YELLOW, will alert the user that he is still in a danger zone and that it is preferred to step back for a safe area. GREEN, which is represented as a safe zone, motivates the user to experience a proper social distancing. 

### How it works?

In this project, the OUTPUT is represented by two programs, Arduino and Processing. In which, both programs are communicating data from the "ultrasonic distance measuring sensor" to motivate the Processing output screen and the LEDs. The LEDs and Processing output screen share the same data; however, they differ from the communication methods. LEDs in this project, receives data directly from the Arduino program, whereas the Processing output screen, the data is obtained from Arduino and then initializing commands in Processing to work.

### Outcome:

The final project helped me to build a successful communication between the "ultrasonic distance measuring sensor" and Processing to motivate different backgrounds in the Processing output screen. 

### Challenges:

The only challenge that I have encountered in this program is the confusion I gained from the map usage compared to if and else if statements. I have discovered that map does not work with my understand well as if statements mainly because if statements can make more sense that map by its process. I consider map as a shortcut, which is helpful when understanding most of the coding concepts.
