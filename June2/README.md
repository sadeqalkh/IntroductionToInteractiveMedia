- In this assignment, I feel that I have learned how to apply loop in the medium of animation. My intension in this assignment is to have a vanishing point path that is protected by the vertical lines.

- Reaching this point resulted from the challenges I passed through from my initial ideas. In which, my intension was to have two different animations in one function, which was from draw(). I often try to run the page, but it mostly results in displaying one animation instead of two. Thus, it leads me to brainstorm and get some inspiration from the article http://dada.compart-bremen.de/docUploads/ProgrammInformation21_PI21.pdf on page 31.
