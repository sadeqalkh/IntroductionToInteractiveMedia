- In this Assignment I feel that I have learned how to apply loop in the medium of an animation. My intension in this assignment is to have a vanishing point path that is protected by the vertical lines.

- Reaching to this point was resulted from challenges I passed through from my initial ideas. In which, my intension was to have two different animations in one function which was from draw(). Many times, I try to run the page but it mostly results in displaying one animation instead of two. Thus, it lead me to brainstorm and get some inspiration from the article http://dada.compart-bremen.de/docUploads/ProgrammInformation21_PI21.pdf in page 31.
