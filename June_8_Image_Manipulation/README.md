### Concept:

The concept of this program is to let the users espically photographers to experience an easier way of making some annoying decisions which may waste a lot of time. As the output screen pops to the user, the user should tap once to have a choice on which photograph he/she needs to edit. 

### Challenges:

The challenges I have encountered in this program was to understand how I can upload a collection of pictures to represent one variable, such as in Daniel Shiffman's example in Chapter 15.3, "ImageArray1." I then looked into the data from his example to understand why many pictures represent a single variable. As the program calls for a data ends with a zero, the program then proceeds to the next number until there is an endpoint. My endpoint was "4" to represent five different images to be saved in the array "PImages[]."
