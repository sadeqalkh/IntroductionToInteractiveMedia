### Concept:

The concept of this program is to give the user the ability to experience two different musical instruments to create specific tones. The analog reader in this program, the Distance Measuring Sensor, helps create different tones depending on particular ranges of a subject's distance. The sounds of this measurement are connected to Arduino's Buzzer. These tones from the analog reader are considered frequencies in the program, in which there are ten different frequencies that the reader can input to the program. The concept of the Distance Measuring Sensor and Buzzer has similarities to DJs. For instance, a DJ would choose specific areas from a Disc to manipulate a song based on its continuity. The analog reader from the example is similar because the user in the future may want to add specific tones to the Buzzer and can be manipulated through the moving one's hand to the analog reader. 
The second concept in this program is the implementation of a digital reader (Button) and a servo. Their role in the program is to be considered one instrument which a user can control at any time. The sound effect of this instrument, like any other actual instrument, can have different tones, and that is by moving it to various surfaces. The user's role from this instrument is to be creative.

### Outcome:

This program allowed me to experience the Distance Measuring Sensor, Buzzer and an essential example from Arduino, "Blink Without Delay." I acknowledged the implementation of the "Blink Without Delay" example if I had no more than four different delays in the program. 

### Challenges:

I have encountered one central challenge in this program, which does not help it to run ideally, and that is from the function delay(). For my mind, it was hard to believe that the "Blink Without Delay" was any simpler from the function delay(). From my previous assignments, I learned that I should contain every declaration in the program at its simplest, not adding or coping similar declarations in the manner of not being confused while reading the code. For three hours, I was researching a more untroubled way of declaring many steps to the program by not using either "Blink Without Delay" or the function delay(). The research did not help me as I expected as I found that every site or person refers back to the Arduino example "Blink Without Delay." I tried to implement the example "Blink Without Delay" in my program but led me to feel confused reading and to remember my past codes. Thus, it wasted much valuable time. I then tried to experiment with LEDs to blink at different modes. The change in the modes has resulted from a digital reader (Switch). It worked, as I believed that it had not more than five delays in total. I returned to my assignment, and I figured there were more than ten delay() functions. I tried to run through them all but only helped run the program with similar issues to the function delay().
